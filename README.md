# Understanding malaria transmission and vectors ecology in Cambodia through machine learning

## Description

An open-source project analysing malaria vectors ecology in Cambodia using machine learning, based on data collected during my PhD. 

This repository was created to share potentially relevant data to others, but also to support open science, while not promoting the currently biased and unsustainable academic publication system. 

Anyone is free to participate and use the data, even though the collections are already a few years old and it is a pretty niche interest.

- Collection date: 2019-2020
- Collection site: Kaev Seima District, Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia
- Affiliation: Molecular Malaria Epidemiology Unit, Pasteur Institute of Cambodia
